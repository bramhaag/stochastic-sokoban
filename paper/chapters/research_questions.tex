\section{Research questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{RQ1}.] To what extent do the stochastic additions influence the solutions generated by the model checker?
    \item[\textbf{RQ2}.] On average, which of the three model checkers, Storm, Modest, and PRISM, is the best suited for solving probabilistic Sokoban models?
