\section{Related work}
There exist many Sokoban solvers, such as Festival\footnote{\url{https://festival-solver.site/}} and Sokolution\footnote{\url{http://codeanalysis.fr/sokoban/}}. The goal of this research however is not to create a solver for (a stochastic version of) Sokoban, but to create a model that a probabilistic model checker will solve.

A project similar to this research has been implemented that generates Sokoban models, which are then used to benchmark three different model checking tools: LTSmin, DiVinE, and nuXmv \cite{comparing_sokoban}. This research solely focused on the standard implementation of Sokoban and therefore benchmarked non-stochastic models with non-probabilistic model checkers. In contrast, this research only considers stochastic models and probabilistic model checking tools.

Similarly, another project focuses on generating models for various logic puzzles, including Sokoban, for LTSmin \cite{ltsmin-puzzles}. This research is different from the mentioned project for the same reasons mentioned above.
