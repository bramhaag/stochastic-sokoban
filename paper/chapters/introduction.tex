\section{Introduction}
Systems that exhibit probabilistic behaviour exist everywhere: computer networks, security protocols, and traffic flows, among others. Using probabilistic model checking, a technique used to verify the correctness of a model of a stochastic system, one can compute bounds on the likelihood that a state will be reached. This can help prevent undesirable behaviour, such as a system crash or a deadlock. As these systems get more complex, it is important to use tools that can verify these models efficiently.

Sokoban is a puzzle game where a player pushes boxes into pre-defined locations. Solving Sokoban levels has been proven to be an NP-hard problem \cite{sokoban-np}. Introducing stochastic behaviour into this game will allow for the game to be used to benchmark probabilistic model checking tools. This is done by defining a probability that determines how often the model checker deviates from the shortest solution.

The goal of this research is to generate probabilistic models from Sokoban levels in various formats so that these models can be used as part of a more extensive test suite to benchmark existing probabilistic model checking tools in competitions such as QComp\footnote{\url{https://qcomp.org/}}.
