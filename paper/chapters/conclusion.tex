\section{Conclusion}
Out of the three model checkers tested, Storm is the most capable of solving the probabilistic Sokoban levels. However, this comes at the cost of increased memory usage and a higher average time to solve levels. None of the model checkers ran out of memory within the time constraints. However, Storm used more than five times the amount of memory than the other tested model checkers.

The stochastic additions to the Sokoban game greatly influence the solutions generated by the model checkers. On average, the parameter that controls how often a player makes a mistake, $\mu$, determines how difficult the model will be to solve for the model checker. The higher the probability of making a mistake, the longer it takes for the model checker to solve certain properties, such as finding the maximum probability of completing the level.
