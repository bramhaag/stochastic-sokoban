Sokoban is a challenging puzzle game for both humans and computers. By modifying the game to include stochastic elements, it can be used to benchmark different probabilistic modelling tools. This research introduces a novel tool that can generate probabilistic models of Sokoban levels. These models can then be used to compare various aspects of probabilistic model checkers and find the best performing one.
