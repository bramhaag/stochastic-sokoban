\section{Related work}
There exist many Sokoban solvers, such as Festival\footnote{\url{https://festival-solver.site/}} and Sokolution\footnote{\url{http://codeanalysis.fr/sokoban/}}. The goal of this research however is not to create a solver for (a stochastic version of) Sokoban, but to create a model that will be solved by a model checker.

A project similar to this research has been implemented that generates Sokoban models, which are then used to benchmark three different model checking tools: LTSmin, DiVinE and nuXmv\cite{comparing_sokoban}. It solely researched non-stochastic models, whereas this research only considers stochastic models and probabilistic model checking tools. While there was a comparison between a simple and more optimized model in that research, there was no attempt to find the optimal encoding of the player and box positions like there is in this research.

Similarly, another project focuses on generating models for various logic puzzles, including Sokoban, for LTSmin\cite{ltsmin-puzzles}. This research is different from the mentioned project for the same reasons as mentioned above.
